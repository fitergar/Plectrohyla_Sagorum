This directory contains the initial data, Gibbs Sampling codes, and results files for the Spring (Sp) season for all regions. 

The initial data was constructed by a simulation of a Linear Poisson Process of intensity rho = 0.56 individuals/m.

Density data and fieldwork methodology by season are reported in Section 2. Sections 3.3 and 3.4.

The Run_N_Times bash scripts allows one to run N number of simulations over all regions and the Join_by_ID generates the Data_Frame_Full which contains the result
of the simulation joined to their corresponding geographical coordinate.
