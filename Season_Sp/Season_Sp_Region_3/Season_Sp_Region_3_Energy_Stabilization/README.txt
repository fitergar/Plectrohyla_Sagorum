[1] The graph "energy_R3E1" shows the energy stabilization in Region 3 for the Spring (Sp) season, with a total of (10^6)*(M) iterations of the Gibbs Sampling, where M=8401 is the total number of sites in Region 3.

[2] The graph "r3E1_energia" shows Energy stabilization in spring (Sp). The graphs show the first two million iterations of the Gibbs Sampling.
