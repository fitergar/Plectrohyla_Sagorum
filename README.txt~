This directory contains the initial data, Gibbs Sampling codes, and results files for the Fall (Fa) season for all regions. 

The initial data was constructed by a simulation of a Linear Poisson Process of intensity rho = 0.31 individuals/m.

Density data and fieldwork methodology by season are reported in Section 2. Sections 3.3 and 3.4.
