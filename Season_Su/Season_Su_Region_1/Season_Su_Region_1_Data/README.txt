The file "r1E2_datos.txt" contains the Poisson simulation data for the number of individuals in the River sites in Region 1, for the Summer (Su) season. The description of the columns is as follows:

- The first column corresponds to site tag in Region 1.

- The second column corresponds to the neighborhood class of the site according to the distance from the river (class 0 for river sites and a positive integer value in the other sites).

- The third column corresponds to the number of individuals of the species at the site. For River sites the number of individuals is artificially determined by a Poisson process based on field data; the number of individuals is assumed to be zero for all of the other sites.
