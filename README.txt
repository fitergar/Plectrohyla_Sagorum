This repository contains the source code used in the article *Seasonal Spatial Distributions of Amphibians and Gibbs Measures: A New Approach Inspired in Hamiltonian Mechanics.   

The files are organized by season, and within each season, by region. Each region folder includes the corresponding source code and a compiled version of the algorithm to run simulations.

Parameters.csv contains the simulation parameters for each season and region.

The neighborhood_structure directory holds information about the first-order neighborhood relations, which are required by the C code. 

Centroides-Elevacion_QGIS.csv provides the geographical coordinates of the grid structure used. This file is essential for reconstructing the distribution maps in QGIS.
