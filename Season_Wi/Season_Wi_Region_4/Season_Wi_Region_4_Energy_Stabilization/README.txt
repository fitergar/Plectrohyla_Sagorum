[1] The graph "energy_R4E4" shows the energy stabilization in Region 4 for the Winter (Wi) season, with a total of (10^6)*(M) iterations of the Gibbs Sampling, where M=13715 is the total number of sites in Region 4.

[2] The graph "r4E4_energia" shows Energy stabilization for the Winter (Su) season. The graphs show the first two million iterations of the Gibbs Sampling.
