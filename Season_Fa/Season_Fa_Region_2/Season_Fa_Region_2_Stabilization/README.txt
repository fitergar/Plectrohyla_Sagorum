[1] The graph "energia_R2E2" shows the energy stabilization in Region 2 for the Fall (Fa) season, with a total of (10^6)*(M) iterations of the Gibbs Sampling, where M=7747 is the total number of sites in Region 2. See Figure 12b.

[2] The graph "r2E2_energia" shows energy stabilization in Fall (Fa). The graphs show the first two million iterations of the Gibbs Sampling. See Figure 13b
