[1] The graph "energia_R1E3" shows the energy stabilization in Region 1 for the Fall (Fa) season, with a total of (10^6)*(M) iterations of the Gibbs Sampling, where M=9310 is the total number of sites in Region 1. See Figure 12a

[2] The graph "r1E3_energia" shows energy stabilization in Fall (Fa). The graphs show the first two million iterations of the Gibbs Sampling. Figure 13a.
