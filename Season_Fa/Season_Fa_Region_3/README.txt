[1] The directory "Region_3_Season_Fa_Data" contains the initial data file for Rgion 3 corresponding to the Fall (Fa) season. The initial data were constructed from a Linear Poisson Process simulation (with density rho=0.31, obtained as a result of fieldwork). See Sections 2 and 3.

[2] The directory "Region_3_Season_Fa_Gibbs_Sampling" contains the C code for the simulation of the number of individuals of the species for each cell in Rgion 3, and the density distribution of individuals, and the energy of the Hamiltonian simulations, for the Fall (Fa) season. See Sections 3 and 4.

[3] The directory "Region_3_Season_Fa_Results" contains the output files produced by the code. See Subsection 8.3.

[4] The directory "Region_3_Season_Fa_Energy_Stabilization" contains graphs corresponding to the simulation results of the Hamiltonian energy values ​​proposed in the model. See Figure 4d and Figure 9d. The images were created using Python.

[5] The directory "Region_3_Season_Fa_Maps" contains maps corresponding to the distribution of individuals as well as heat maps, using the code output files. See Figure 16a and Figure 17a. The images were created using QGIS.
