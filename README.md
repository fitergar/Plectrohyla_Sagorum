# üê∏ Population Modeling of *Plectrohyla sagorum*  
*A Hamiltonian & Geo-statistical Approach*

---

## üìñ Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a **novel statistical mechanics-based approach** for studying **population dynamics** of individuals in ecology across different seasons of the year.  

We apply our method to the case of the vulnerable amphibian **_Plectrohyla sagorum_** ([IUCN, 2020](https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/55853/a54352590)), a stream-breeding frog inhabiting the **cloud forests of the Tacan√° Volcano Biosphere Reserve, Chiapas, Mexico**.

Our approach combines:

- ‚öõÔ∏è **Hamiltonian framework from physics** (kinetic + potential terms)  
- üåç **Geo-statistics** and **Markov Random Fields (MRF)**  
- üßÆ **Approximate minimization problems** inspired by statistical mechanics  

This fusion allows us to generate **probability distributions of individuals** across seasons, reflecting ecological processes such as spreading during rainy seasons and attraction to streams during the dry season.  

---

## üß™ Methodology Highlights

- Individuals' distribution is modeled as a balance between:
  - **Kinetic term** ‚Üí spreading across the region  
  - **Potential term** ‚Üí attraction to water bodies  

- The **Hamiltonian minimization** provides equilibrium states that balance both tendencies.  
- **Markov Random Fields** ensure spatial consistency across neighboring regions.  
- **Coupling constants** are fitted from field data (frog counts and locations).  

This yields **probability distributions** of frog abundance per location, reconstructed across seasons.

## üê∏ Biological Case Study  

- **Species**: *Plectrohyla sagorum*  
- **Habitat**: Canyon stream within cloud forest, Tacan√° Volcano Biosphere Reserve, Chiapas, Mexico.  
- **Key ecological insights**:  
  - In the **dry season (winter)** ‚Üí frogs cluster near streams.  
  - In the **rainy season** ‚Üí frogs disperse farther away from the river.

## üìê Mathematical Method

The simulation is based on a **lattice model with local interactions**, inspired by methods from statistical mechanics.

- The study region is discretized into a **grid of sites** (see `Geographic Data/Centroides-Elevacion_QGIS.csv`), each representing a spatial unit.
- Each site is assigned a **state variable**, which evolves according to:
  - **Local rules** depending on the site's attributes, and
  - **Neighborhood interactions** defined by adjacency relations (see `Geographic Data/Neighborhood_Structure/`).

Formally, the system configuration is represented by a vector:

$
\omega = (\omega_{i,j})_{(i,j) \in \Lambda},
$

where $\omega_{i,j}$ is the average numbers of frogs in cell $(i,j)$ and $\Lambda$ is the grid of all cells.  

The **energy functional** (Hamiltonian) is defined as:

$
H(\omega) = H_0(\omega) + V_g(\omega),
$

where

$
H_0(\omega) = \sum_{\ell \sim \jmath} (\omega_\ell - \omega_\jmath)^2
$

represents local differences between neighboring cells (with $\ell \sim \jmath$ indicating neighbors from `Geographic Data/Neighborhood_Structure/r*_vecinos.txt`), and

$
V_g(\omega) = g \sum_{\ell \in \Lambda} d_\ell^2 \, \omega_\ell
$

is a potential term representing the attraction, with $d_\ell$ the distance of cell $\ell$ to the river and $g$ a coupling constant (stored in `Geographic Data/parameters.csv`).

The **probability of a configuration** is given by the Gibbs distribution:

$
\pi(\omega) = \frac{1}{Z} \exp\Big(-\frac{1}{T} H(\omega)\Big),
$

where T is a temperature parameter (from `Geographic Data/parameters.csv`) and Z is the partition function:

$
Z = \sum_{\omega \in \Omega} \exp\Big(-\frac{1}{T} H(\omega)\Big).
$

### üóÇ Conditional Probabilities per Region and Season

The grid is divided by the river into regions $\Lambda_1, \Lambda_2, \Lambda_3, \Lambda_4$, with corresponding configuration spaces $\Omega^1,\Omega^2,\Omega^3,\Omega^4$. For each region $i\in \{1,2,3,4\}$, season $x \in \{\rm Sp, Su, Fa, Wi\}$ and $\omega\in \Omega^i$:

$
H_0^{(i,x)}(\omega) = \sum_{s_1 \sim s_2} (\omega_{s_1} - \omega_{s_2})^2 +\sum_{\substack{s\sim r\\  r\in R}}(\omega_s-
\boldsymbol{\omega}^{x}_r)^2
$

$
V_{g^{(i,x)}}^{(i,x)}(\omega) = g^{(i,x)} \sum_{s \in \Lambda^i} d_s^2 , \omega_s
$

$
H^{(i,x)}(\omega) = H_0^{(i,x)}(\omega) + V_{g^{(i,x)}}^{(i,x)}(\omega)
$

where $\boldsymbol{\omega}^x_r$ is the observed (or Poisson-simulated) number of individuals on the river cell $r$ for season $x$ (found in `Season_*/Season_*_Region_*/Season_*_Region_*_Data/*_datos.txt`), and $g^{(i,x)}$ is the region- and season-specific coupling constant (stored in `Geographic Data/parameters.csv`).

Conditional probability of a configuration in region $i$ given river data:

$
\pi^{(i,x)}(\omega) = \frac{1}{Z^{(i,x)}} \exp\Big(-\frac{1}{T} H^{(i,x)}(\omega)\Big)
$

with partition function

$
Z^{(i,x)} = \sum_{\omega \in \Omega^i} \exp\Big(-\frac{1}{T} H^{(i,x)}(\omega)\Big)
$

### üîÑ Stochastic Simulation (Gibbs Sampling)

A **Gibbs sampling sequence** is generated to approximate the equilibrium distribution (implemented in `Season_*/Season_*_Region_*/Season_*_Region_*_Gibbs_Sampling/*.c`):

1. Start from an initial configuration $\omega^{(0;i,x)} = 0$ for all $p \in \Lambda^i$.
2. For each site $\ell_n$ in a fixed neighbor-order sequence, propose a new state $\tilde{\omega}_{\ell_n} \in \{0,1,\dots,K^x\}$ where $K^x$ is the seasonal carrying capacity (from `Geographic Data/parameters.csv`).
3. Accept the proposal with probability:

$
P = \min\Bigg(1, \frac{\pi^{(i,x)}(\tilde{\omega})}{\pi^{(i,x)}(\omega^{(n-1;i,x)})}\Bigg)
= \min\Bigg(1, \exp\Big(-\frac{1}{T} \big[ H^{(i,x)}(\tilde{\omega}) - H^{(i,x)}(\omega^{(n-1;i,x)}) \big] \Big)\Bigg).
$

4. Repeat for all sites and iterate until convergence (monitored via energy traces in `Season_*/Season_*_Region_*/Season_*_Region_*_Energy_Stabilization/`).

This procedure guarantees convergence to the **conditional stationary distribution** under standard conditions (aperiodicity and irreducibility).

---

### üìä Outputs

The simulation generates three types of output files (stored in `Season_*/Season_*_Region_*/Season_*_Region_*_Results/`):

- **Final state vector** $(\omega^{(n;i,x)})$: One realization of the system (files `*_x`)
- **Ergodic averages**: Expectation values used to reconstruct abundance distributions (files `*_p`)
- **Energy traces**: Diagnostic to monitor convergence (files `*_e`)

The ergodic averages are used for the actual prediction and heat maps (visualized in `Season_*/Season_*_Maps/`).

# üìÇ Repository Structure

<details>
<summary>Parent Directory</summary>

The parent directory contains three main components: **Geographic Data**, **Seasonal Directories**, and **Scripts**. This structure mirrors the spatial inputs, seasonal segmentation, and automation needed to run all experiments.

---

## üåç Geographic Data

<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

This section holds the spatial inputs used by the simulations. Objects created in **QGIS** receive a **unique feature ID**, which is used across files to consistently join geometry, centroids, neighborhoods, and model outputs. Note that there are two types of IDs per grid coordinate: a **Global ID** that is independent of the region, and for each region another **Local ID**.

### **Neighborhood_Structure/**
- One file per region (e.g., `r1_vecinos.txt` ‚Ä¶ `r4_vecinos.txt`).
- Each row lists **neighbor QGIS IDs** for a given cell (first-order adjacency). Here **Local IDs** are used.
- Used to define the first-order neighborhood relation and is utilized by the Gibbs sampler program.
- This adjacency structure is crucial for the spatial correlation modeling in the Markov Random Field framework.

### **Centroides-Elevacion_QGIS.csv**
- Columns include: **ID**, **x**, **y**, **z**.
- **ID** matches the QGIS **Global ID** for each cell.
- Used to reconstruct spatial maps and bind results to coordinates.
- The elevation data (z-coordinate) provides topographic context for the ecological modeling.

### **parameters.csv**
- Lists all parameters used for the simulations for each season and region.
- For each season there is a unique value of:
  - Temperature **T** (affects species distribution patterns)
  - Maximum number of individuals on the river **K** (carrying capacity)
  - Density of individuals along the river **œÅ** (rho)
- For each Season-Region pair there is a value for the coupling constant **g** (controls spatial interaction strength)
- These parameters are derived from field observations and calibrated to match ecological patterns.
